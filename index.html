      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>
We store a significant amount of sensitive data online such as personally
identifying information, trade secrets, family pictures, and customer
information. The data that we store should be encrypted in transit and at rest
but is often not protected in an appropriate manner.
This specification describes a privacy-respecting mechanism for storing,
indexing, and retrieving encrypted data at a storage provider. It is often
useful when an individual or organization wants to protect data in a way that
the storage provider cannot view, analyze, aggregate, or resell the data.
This approach also ensures that application data is portable and protected

        <h3>Why Do We Need Secure Data Hubs?</h3>

        <p class="issue">
Explain why individuals and organizations that want to protect their privacy,
trade secrets, and ensure data portability will benefit from using this
technology. Explain how giving a standard API for the storage of user data
empowering users to "bring their own storage", giving them control of their
own information. Explain how applications that are written against a standard
API and assume that users will bring their own storage can separate concerns
and focus on the functionality of their application, removing the need to
deal with storage infrastructure (instead leaving it to a specialist service
provider that is chosen by the user).

        <h3>Ecosystem Overview</h3>

        <p>
This section describes the roles of the core actors and the relationships
between them in an ecosystem where this specification is expected
to be useful. A role is an abstraction that might be implemented in many
different ways. The separation of roles suggests likely interfaces and
protocols for standardization. The following roles are introduced in this
specification:
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt><dfn>data hub controller</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
A role an <a>entity</a> might perform by creating, managing, and deleting
data hubs. This entity is also responsible for granting and revoking
authorization to <a>storage agents</a> to the data hubs that are under its
control.
          </dd>
          <dt><dfn data-lt="storage agents">storage agent</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
A role an <a>entity</a> might perform by creating, updating, and deleting
data in a data hub. This entity is typically granted authorization to
to access a data hub by a <a>data hub controller</a>.
          </dd>
          <dt><dfn>storage provider</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
A role an <a>entity</a> might perform by providing a raw data storage
mechanism to a <a>data hub controller</a>. It is impossible for this entity
to see the data that it is storing due to all data being encrypted at rest
and in transit to and from the <a>storage provider</a>.
          </dd>
        </dl>

        <h3>Use Cases and Requirements</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>
TBD
          </li>

As a result of documenting and analyzing the use cases document, the following
desirable ecosystem characteristics were identified for this specification:

      <p>
The following sections outline core concepts, such as ...
which form the foundation of this specification.

        <h2>Encrypted Storage</h2>

        <p class="issue">
Explain why storing data encrypted at rest is a good idea and how you can
control who has access to what data in a more fine grained way by doing this.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="normative">
        <h2>Structured Documents</h2>

        <p>
The fundamental unit of storage in data hubs is the encrypted
structured document which, when decrypted, provides a data structure that
can be expressed in popular syntaxes such as JSON and CBOR. Documents can
store structured data and metadata about the structured data. Structured
document sizes are limited to 16MB.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="normative">
        <h2>Streams</h2>

        <p>
For files larger than 16MB or for raw binary data formats such as audio,
video, and office productivity files, a streaming API is provided that
enables data to be streamed to/from a data hub. Streams are described using
structured documents, but the storage of the data is separated from the
structured document using a hashlink to the encrypted content.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="normative">
        <h2>Indexing</h2>

        <p>
Data hubs are expected to store a very large number of documents
of varying kinds. This means that it is important to be able to search the
documents in a timely way, which creates a challenge for the storage provider
as the content is encrypted. An encrypted search scheme is provided for
secure data hubs that enable data hub clients to do meta data indexing while
not leaking metadata to the storage provider.

A website may provide service endpoint discovery by embedding JSON-LD in their
top-most HTML web page (e.g. at <code>https://example.com/</code>):

&lt;!DOCTYPE html>
&lt;html lang="en">

Service descriptions may also be requested via content negotiation.
In the following example a JSON-compatible service description is provided
(e.g. <code>curl -H "Accept: application/json" https://example.com/</code>):

        <h2>Creating Encrypted Indexes</h2>

        <p>
It is often useful to search a data hub for structured documents that contain
specific metadata. Efficient searching requires the use of search indexes
and local access to data. This poses an interesting challenge as the
search has to be performed on the <a>storage provider</a> without leaking
information that could violate the privacy of the entities that are storing
information in the data hub. This section details how encrypted indexes
can be created and used to perform efficient searching while protecting
the privacy of entities that are storing information in the data hub.
        </p>

        <p>
When creating an <a>EncryptedDocument</a>, blinded index properties MAY
be utilized to perform efficient searches. An example of the use of these
properties is shown below:
        </p>

        <pre class="example highlight" title="Example encrypted document with encrypted indexes">

}
        </pre>

        <p class="note">
The example above demonstrates the use of unique index values as well as
non-unique indexes.
        </p>

        <p>
The example above enables the <a>storage provider</a> to build
efficient indexes on encrypted properties while enabling
<a>storage agents</a> to search the information without leaking information
that would create privacy concerns.
        </p>

        <p class="issue">
Provide instructions and examples for how indexes are blinded using an
HMAC key.
        </p>

        <p class="issue">
Explain that multiple entities can maintain their own independent indexes
(using their own HMAC key) provided they have been granted this capability.
Explain that indexes can be sparse/partial. Explain that indexes have their
own sequence number and that it will match the document's sequence number
once it is updated.

        <h2>Searching Encrypted Documents</h2>

        <p>
The contents of a data hub can be searched using encrypted indexes created
using the processes described in <a href="#creating-encrypted-indexes"></a>.
There are two primary ways of searching for encrypted documents. The first
is to search for a specific value associated with a specific index. The
second is to search to see if a specific index exists on a document.
        </p>

        <p>
The example below demonstrates how to search for a specific value associated
with a specific index.
        </p>

        <pre class="example highlight" title="Data hub query for a specifically indexed value">
POST https://example.com/data-hubs/z4sRgBJJLnYy HTTP/1.1

  ]
}
        </pre>

        <p>
A successful query will result in a standard HTTP 200 response with a list of
identifiers for all encrypted documents that match the query:

        </pre>

        <p>
The contents of a data hub can also be searched to see if a certain attribute
name is indexed by using the <code>has</code> keyword.
        </p>

        <pre class="example highlight" title="Data hub query for a particular attribute name">

If the query above is successful, an HTTP 200 code is expected with a list
